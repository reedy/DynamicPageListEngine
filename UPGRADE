== Upgrading ==

To upgrade, simply [[{{NAMESPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}#Installation|install]] the most recent version.

=== Upgrading from 0.3 or earlier ===

With version 1.0.0, almost all configuration parameters and messages names have been changed. If you have customized any of them, you need to adapt your configuration.

Since version 1.0.0, pages using DynamicPageListEngine are assigned to a [[mw:Help:Tracking_categories|tracking category]]. If you already have such pages, you can fix the categories either by performing a [[mw:Manual:Purge#Null_edits|null edit]] on each page or by executing the script <code>maintenance/refreshLinks.php</code>. Note that the latter may take a considerable amount of time.
